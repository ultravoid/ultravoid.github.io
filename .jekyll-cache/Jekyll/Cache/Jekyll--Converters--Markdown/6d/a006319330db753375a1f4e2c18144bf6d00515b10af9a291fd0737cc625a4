<p>Latâ€™rel brought fire to the Dread Ones<br />
The hero of Yaâ€™tacu plucked them from the sky<br />
Latâ€™rel pointed to Godorix the butcher<br />
And before her feet touched the ground<br />
Latâ€™rel sent him to his gods<br /></p>

<p>Dread Knights know not surrender<br />
Dread Knights know only blood and fire<br /></p>

<p>Latâ€™rel gave them blood and fire - translated from the Hyper-Kon, by Vetaxa poet of the Egliseâ€™es</p>

<p><em>We Go On</em> song of the Sotor Gimâ€™det</p>

<p>We go on<br />
We go on<br /></p>

<p>It was not the end<br />
First comet emptied our ocean<br />
and washed our shores away<br /></p>

<p>First comet put fire to our sky<br />
and sheathed our cradle in smoke<br />
It was not the end<br /></p>

<p>We go on<br />
We go on<br /></p>

<p>It was not the end<br />
Second comet emptied our hope<br />
and washed our fears away<br /></p>

<p>Second comet put courage in our minds<br />
and blew the smoke from our hearts<br />
It was not the end<br /></p>

<p>We go on<br />
We go on<br /></p>
