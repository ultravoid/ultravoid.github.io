<p><em>Shresta Primatt (Void city)</em></p>

<p><em>The border of the Erappa</em></p>

<p>As their shuttle thrusters fired to alter course, Gettaâ€™tai and Regmaâ€™tai were pushed hard into their seats and Regma could only speak between fights for breath. â€œthis wasnâ€™t a good ideaâ€¦.you are going too fastâ€¦our orbit is too lowâ€¦.weâ€™re going to get fined againâ€ Regmaâ€™tai complained to her mate and partner â€œhmpf..whateverâ€ replied Gettaâ€™tai, his bright yellow eyes darting between consoles and gauges as he worked the shuttle controls with his slender, dark chen gara hands â€œyou knew if we got stuck behind that <em>Semlous</em> freighter we could of been floating in mag lock for another ritodex (~11 days)â€¦â€ Regma left it at that and went back to monitoring the shuttle instruments, if something was going to fail it would be now. A cold death was as close as misjudgment or bad luck Regmaâ€™s first father had always said. He also said not to add distracting arguments to that list of hazards, especially ones that could be settled later.</p>

<p>Getta powered down the thrusters, easing them from their seats and putting the shuttle on its final path to their destination, which was the mega city space station <em>Shresta Primatt</em> orbiting the gas giant <em>Shresta</em>. The planet <em>Shresta</em> itself â€”which had given the station its nameâ€” was a large, hot ball of gas with more than a hundred moons in the <em>Baraâ€™tex</em> star system. When the ancestors of Getta and Regma first floated to this world they knew it to be a special place, with moons that were bountiful in metals and ices and a large magnetic fieldâ€¦.everything a <em>chen gara</em> (petaâ€™megi, â€˜star borneâ€™) needed to thrive and build.</p>

<p>In addition to plentiful resources, Shresta burns with radiation, Regma could feel it like a low, cold tingle giving vigor to her body and bones. More so when they traveled to the city from their home on the far moon. The chen gara had adapted to the cosmic fields in the endless vacuum, and what causes sickness in many firma bound species, gives them life.</p>

<p>â€œlooks we are in range of the supply net signalâ€¦â€ Getta said, without responding Regma powered up the radio antennas and receivers, and downloaded the latest manifests from the logi guilds on the stationâ€¦ â€œWe have a signal. They have everything we need it looks likeâ€ Regma said as she scanned the provision guild inventories with some disappointmentâ€¦ â€œnot much fresh fruit thoughâ€ she said to Getta, making her smooth dark angular face disappointed. Getta responded with regret in his voice â€œagh, that is unfortunateâ€¦â€</p>

<p>As had become their habit over the 20 adex (~20 years) they had made this journey, once they had a enough com signal to get data streams Getta attempted to raise the station landing towers â€œâ€¦Shresta tower this is cargo shuttle <em>Setakâ€™tai</em> on apoapsis intercept, requesting public berthingâ€¦â€ After the fourth try the <em>Shresta</em> landing authority responded â€œWe see you shuttle <em>Setakâ€™tai</em> at ten interum (1000 seconds) to mag lock, twelve interum to descentâ€¦cutting it close shuttle <em>Setakâ€™tai</em>â€¦â€ the station continued with instructions to prepare to for docking and, to Regmaâ€™s relief no mention of their high speed approach.</p>

<p><em>Shresta Primatt</em> is a massive, ancient construct of steel and stone finished white in the tradition of the chen gara. It had been built in orbit by the ancestors of Getta and Regma nearly five tekadex (~5,000 years) ago. Then â€”by its original plansâ€” it had a circumference of ten tekudex (~15 miles) with enough centrifugal habs to house a hundred thousand <em>chen gara</em>. Over time like many other bastions of the void borne, it had grown with needs and populations. In the time of Regma and Getta <em>Shresta Primatt</em> is home to millions of souls from thousands of gene-lines and its size is a hundred fold its original. Now it is a great amalgamation of hab sectors, shipyards, foundries, and trade hubs, all inhabited by <em>chen gara</em> and hundreds of other races and species. As more sections were added, tall spires were built, and those spires were eventually connected by platforms and bridges, and on those were built more towers and platforms, to those were attached workshops and trade sectors, and on top of those still even taller spires were raised.</p>

<p>It is one of the best examples of a void borne â€œspace mega cityâ€ and Regma felt a buzz of pride for her ancestors that built the <em>Shresta Primatt</em>. Written deep below the spires and foundries on the original sectionâ€™s hull, the builders wrote the stationâ€™s motto on a platinum plate etched in diamond and gold, <em>â€œIn the sky of Shresta this station shines, until the frontier breaksâ€</em>.</p>

<p>When the city is viewed from a higher orbit, it resembles a scalloped plate floating across the brown, red, and white clouds of <em>Shresta</em>, or, some might say a flower-shaped cookie floating in tea with cream. Viewed from below â€”the direction from which shuttle <em>Setakâ€™tai</em> approachedâ€” it appears as it is, a massive city floating in the stars with uncountable towers reaching 20 or 30 tekudex (~30-45 miles) or farther into space from the main station.</p>

<p>As the <em>Setakâ€™tai</em> approached from below, <em>Shresta Primatt</em> began to move into the shadow of <em>Shresta</em>. The sunset bathed the bottom of the station in deep scarlet red followed by the advancing shadow of night. As Regma watched the spectacle of artificial night overtake the brilliant red, and the station lights lit up in its wake, she reached across the the cockpit and grasped Gettaâ€™s hand. He grasped back and smiledâ€¦it was a rare and beautiful sight that they had only witnessed a handful of times. â€œIâ€™ll take that as good luckâ€ Getta said, Regma was reminded of an old <em>chen gara</em> saying <em>â€œThere is much beauty and hardship in the void, do not meet either aloneâ€</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p>One could tell their whereabouts in Shresta Primatt (or most space cities) by the smell, as soon as the shuttle air locks opened and its air flew out to exchange with the station atmosphere, Regma detected slick grease, acrid fuel, things burning, distant food, subtle rot, and the low smells of the livingâ€¦she was at the docksâ€¦she was home. The clank of their mag boots on the landing deck joined a innumerable chorus of others as they made their way to the landing authority. As they waited for their turn to report to the authority Regma reviewed their supply list which had been written and grouped in no particular orderâ€¦</p>

<p>Time to make the errand list â€œwhich guilds do you want today?â€ she asked Getta as they waited in line â€œI can get the cables and metalsâ€¦I know how much you hate the new fabricatorsâ€¦if you get the provisions and the chem guild stuff, and then we can meet at the tech guild for the transmittersâ€ She nodded just as the authority clerk sitting behind security glass called through a speaker â€œNEXTâ€</p>

<p>The clerk was a many armed and many eyed ancient Rematâ€™hypa whoâ€™s auto translated voice played haltingly through the speaker â€œwhat isâ€¦your purposeâ€¦onâ€¦Shresta Primatt?â€ Getta responded to the traditional bureaucratic welcome â€œsupply run from Andra Palnus, Vetmaâ€™rahdâ€. The clerk responded with the same tempo</p>

<p>clerk: â€œare yourâ€¦suppliesâ€¦for maintenance or building?â€<br />
Getta: â€œbothâ€<br />
clerk: â€œwhatâ€¦is yourâ€¦charter?â€<br />
Getta: â€œcitizen, co-custodian, frontier breakerâ€<br />
clerk: â€œandâ€¦your companion?â€<br />
Getta: â€œthe sameâ€<br />
clerk: *after consulting some unseen data* â€œyour shuttleâ€¦may haveâ€¦two caldex cyclesâ€¦in theâ€¦public berth, if you requireâ€¦housingâ€¦visit theâ€¦Shresta Primattâ€¦housing authorityâ€¦read andâ€¦give heed toâ€¦all warningsâ€¦while visitingâ€¦Shresta Primattâ€¦an accidentalâ€¦deathâ€¦is never farâ€</p>

<p>As Getta was thanking the authority and getting their keys Regma noticed an unusual group of station gendarmes gathering at a large airlock. They formed a line encircling the airlock exit, after they had settled into their places the airlock opened and a striking being in black and silver robes walked out flanked by menacing looking escorts. The being was tall with a smooth oval mirrored helmet they did not remove, she thought they were totally bipedal at first, but then she saw a second set of arms moving under their robes. Behind them were more menacing escorts with what looked to be a prisoner with their hands restrained in between two of them. â€œhave you ever seen anything like that?â€ she asked Getta once he was done with the station clerk. â€œlooks like theyâ€™re bringing someone in, maybe a wanted pirate?â€ Getta offered â€œwho are â€˜theyâ€™â€ Regma responded motioning to the tall black and silver clad entity and their escort on the landing deck below â€œI donâ€™t knowâ€¦not the legion or protectorateâ€¦must be one of those â€˜free ridersâ€™â€¦or whatever they call themselvesâ€¦â€ â€œhmmmâ€ Regma musedâ€¦quickly forgetting them as thoughts of their next task formed in her mind.</p>

<p>She had tried not to think much about the unpleasant topic but could avoid it no moreâ€¦she turned to Getta and asked â€œsoâ€¦â€ his sigh and bowed head told her he already knew what she was going to say â€œâ€¦whoâ€™s family do we visit first?â€</p>
