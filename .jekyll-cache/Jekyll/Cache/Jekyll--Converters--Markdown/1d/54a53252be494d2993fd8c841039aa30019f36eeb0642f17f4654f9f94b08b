I"Î<p>The Chronicle of the Hyper-Kon, book 13, chapter 1, verse 1</p>

<p>_Latâ€™rel brought fire to the Dread Ones<br />
The hero of Yaâ€™tacu plucked them from the sky
Latâ€™rel pointed to Godorix the butcher
And before her feet touched the ground
Latâ€™rel sent him to his gods</p>

<p>Dread Knights know not surrender
Dread Knights know only blood and fire</p>

<p>Latâ€™rel gave them blood and fire_ - translated from the Hyper-Kon, by Vetaxa poet of the Egliseâ€™es</p>

<hr />

<p><em>We Go On</em> song of the Sotor Gimâ€™det</p>

<p>We go on
We go on</p>

<p>It was not the end
First comet emptied our ocean,
and washed our shores away</p>

<p>First comet put fire to our sky,
and sheathed our cradle in smoke
It was not the end</p>

<p>We go on
We go on</p>

<p>It was not the end
Second comet emptied our hope
and washed our fears away</p>

<p>Second comet put courage in our minds
and blew the smoke from our hearts
It was not the end</p>

<p>We go on
We go on</p>
