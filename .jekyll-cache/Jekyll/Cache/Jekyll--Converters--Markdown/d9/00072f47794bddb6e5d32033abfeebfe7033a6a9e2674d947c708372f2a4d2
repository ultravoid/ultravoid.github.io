I"þ<p>Zemo never liked this worldâ€¦<em>Nexi</em> it was called. Things had always been odd at this port of callâ€¦little things. Mag compasses were mostly useless, even though they shouldnâ€™t be, and gear that was normally reliable had to be constantly reset. All forms of coms were unreliable, plagued with static, and prone to channels crossing. And if that was not enough reason to be wary of this place, this system was a mere two jumps to the Ogion protectorate frontier markers and the demons beyond.</p>
