I"Â!<p><strong>Galaxy: Hegusâ€™dra</strong><br />
<strong>Satellite Galaxy: Imroâ€™eth* (the galaxy of iron)</strong><br />
<strong>Sector: Set-dihex 1141 (protectorate designation)</strong><br />
<strong>Planet: Demptoria</strong><br />
<strong>City: Pezemtpa</strong> â€”Capital and seat of government for the Semmeâ€™tatra Federation, homeworld to the Ektaâ€™ra<br /></p>

<p><em>Daemos Rexus*</em></p>

<p>How long did it take these people to build those towers? Very fine works of stone and iron. Taller than mountains.<br />
Only generations of blood and will can raise such things; the blood of ancestors, spent to give a birth right to their descendants.<br />
And now I come â€”the Razer Prince*â€” to ply my trade, to burn that which they have forfeited, and ensure the glory, and honor of the Hypergâ€™enot.</p>

<p>In the distance, siege artillery shells, strike a shield that has stood for a million zeraâ€™ton (~ 500,000 years). <em>Bom. Bom. Bom.</em> Every impact lighting up the protective dome with angry branching sparks that split and crawl into the night.<br /></p>

<p>Each shell, brings this city closer to its destiny, a fate these arrogant <em>Ektaâ€™ra</em> sealed themselves, when they defied the Emperor Diatas â€”my father. <em>Bom. Bom. Bom.</em> The vengeance of my Lion Knights will be brutal. As is fitting for these Ektaâ€™ra who dishonor us with their insolence. My father does not like repeating himself, in his wisdom, mercy leads to repetition.</p>

<p><em>Bom. Bom. Bom.</em></p>

<p>The dynast aide, Lotaxâ€™vet â€”the greyâ€” speaks, his translated voice electronic and flat to the princeâ€™s ears. â€œLord Prince General, the city shields fall.â€ As he foretells, a blinding flash encompasses the city; blue-green arcs of energy snap into the air and ground. The sky above the city becomes an iridescent dome which then vanishes with a loud bang.</p>

<p><em>SNNCRAAACKSHPOPoppop</em></p>

<p>Lotax turns slightly to face his master, his metallic form glinting from beneath his hooded robe. â€œThe city is defenseless my lord.â€ he said.<br />
â€œThe garrison will fight to the last.â€ It will be a <em>beautiful</em>, bloody slaughterâ€¦<br />
â€œThey will my lord. Your Star-Lions* will accommodate their courage. Shall the army continue as planned my Lord Prince?â€<br />
â€œYesâ€¦tell the archâ€™battalions* to cease bombardment. I want every nook and escape tunnel intact so that the razka* hunters can flush out <em>all</em> the infidelos* vermin.â€<br />
â€œAs you wish my lordâ€ Doors swosh open as Lotax exits to disseminate his orders. Waiting acolyte-adjutants* stand still and silent beyond in the adjutant enclave.<br /></p>

<p>The â€˜eternalâ€™ shields fell within a dunestar (~2 weeks), the Lord Generals will not give Lotax problems carrying out my plan. Ladros, Uthmar, Viâ€™kete, and the rest of the Lord <em>argentâ€™generals*</em> didnâ€™t think the shields would fall that quickly. They were right. Until my little mouse that is. Had she not completed her mission, the shields would still stand. I havenâ€™t decided if I should spare her?â€¦</p>

<p>Lotax returns from the adjutant enclave were he made the Lord Princeâ€™s will known, the adjutants now in great activity beyond the enclave doors. â€œAll Generals are affirming your orders Lord Princeâ€ he said.</p>

<p>â€œAs they should. Sevâ€™attendexi*.â€ Vanixâ€™ferri â€”the sevâ€™attendexiâ€” replies as she was trained to â€”in elegant and distinguished Haiâ€™Dreâ€™Cledeshem*. â€œYes my glorious Prince?â€ Such a fine sevâ€™attendexi.<br />
â€œI will address the army and my knights.â€<br />
Vanix works the consoles in front of her, with her four arms, opening audio channels to all Hypergâ€™enot military elements on the planet. Her task complete she says â€œAll-hands, two-way audio established. My radiant Lord Prince may speak when he pleasesâ€<br /></p>

<p>Such a good pet, and such a good investment â€”those extra arms. It is always a thrill to project ones voice to so many champions. Remember what father always says about these times. They fight for blood-honor.<br />
â€œGlorious Knights!â€ The rhythmic pounding of god-hammer gauntlets, war-lances, and his own voice â€”echoing off of the battlements and the landâ€” fill the command enclave.<br />
â€œI CAN HEAR YOU KNIGHTSâ€ The pounding gets louder. The monstrous crashes of the knightâ€™s twenty eight bestere (12 meter) long war-lances against their god-hammer gauntlets, was deafening.<br />
â€œThese Ektaâ€™ra have no faith in the Diatas!â€ The din of the war-lances drowns out the chants from the army. The archâ€™battalions and glorious infantry instead make themselves heard, with bronze and brass war horns, which growled and spit menacing tones to mix with the knightâ€™s crashing of steel.<br />
â€œThey are ungrateful for the gifts they have on this world, they have rejected my fathers generosity, they dishonor us, by refusing to surrender what is ours.â€ Shells no longer fall on the city, but the din echoing off the walls alone seems to threaten to flatten the city.<br />
â€œTheir unbreakable shield is broken, their garrison awaits SLAUGHTERâ€ <em>Hydaaa Hydaaa Hydaaa</em> <em>Rexus Revmet Rexus Revmet</em> Amplified chants for glory of the Hypergâ€™enot, begin to mix with the pounding god-hammers and blaring siege horns.<br /></p>

<p>â€œArchâ€™battalions! Bring down that wall!â€</p>

<p><em>Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom bom</em></p>

<p>The battalionâ€™s shells land true, and an entire letâ€™con (~2 mile) stretch of ancient wall, blossoms into grey dusty fireballs. As the dust clears it reveals shining buildings of glass and steel beyond.</p>

<p>â€œI Lord Princes Daemos Rexus decree that the Ektaâ€™ra are shakaâ€™infidelos*. Storm this city! Crush what fighters remain! All Ektaâ€™ra; be they adult, infirm, child, or infant! Put them to flame and blade! <em>Tear</em> into them! Until they are but meat for dogs! Put them to the flame until their bones are but wisps of <em>ash</em>! Give them death! Give them the <em>freedom</em> they so desire! When you are done my Knights, whatever is left can beg for slavery or death! Put this city <em>Pezemtpa</em> to righteous flame! May its name never again be spoken! Hypergâ€™enot eternal legion! Advance!â€ Vanix cut the feed as ordered, but the war cries of the eternal legion still filled the command enclave, only fading with distance as they advanced on the doomed city.</p>

<p>They could have given it up piece meal. Instead we will burn everything until the name Ektaâ€™ra is only a memory. The disgraced ground of this planet â€”Demptoriaâ€” will feed many colonies; its mountains will build many shard-cruisers, chariots, war-lances, and god-hammers. Its core will armor them all. We will use whatever is left as slaves and fertilizer. We will take all of it as we please. All of it.</p>

<p>â€œThe Lion-Knights are engaging the city garrison. The infidelos fall quickly. They fall to the last.â€ Intoned Lotax.</p>

<p>I want to see them. I want to watch as the legacy of this place dies. â€œReady my guard and thunder-talon. I want to be there when the last of them die.â€
â€œBy your will, my Prince.â€</p>

<p>Glory eternal to the Hypergâ€™enot. Death and oblivion to the infidelos</p>
