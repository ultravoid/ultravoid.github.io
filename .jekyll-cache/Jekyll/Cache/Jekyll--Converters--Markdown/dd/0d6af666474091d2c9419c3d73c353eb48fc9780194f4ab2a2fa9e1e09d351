<p><em>Northern polar mountains</em><br />
<em>Pirx’vero Botha, exa’legionate trooper, long range infantry support (sniper/medic)</em></p>

<p>It was a bug hunt —a primal bug hunt; that’s all we ever get sent on; that’s all us —the expeditionary, the <em>exa’legionate</em>.</p>

<p>I hate bug hunts —primal or otherwise—, hive swarmers feel no pain, and dispense it without mercy. On a bug drop, being on overwatch is mostly the same as any other; being a medic is much more difficult. Why are citizens living on this shadt hole of a world anyway? Haven’t seen any greenery, the weather is bad; it matches the landscape. Those clouds don’t look like rain clouds; too hot for water here; lots of lightning; blue, yellow, and white. The bolts extend the sharp angels of the mountain terrain; sometimes in lone strikes, sometimes in rolling volleys. Nature —at least on this world— used the same pallet for its black and grey clouds, as it did for the grey rocks and the shadows they cast. We’ve been in these mountains for half an caldex (~14 hours) scouring the area of the last known position of a lost militia. Haven’t seen a trace. Don’t think anyone expects to find any either.</p>

<p>When we had been told what to expect, —during pre-drop briefing on the Legionatus drop ship. Commander Ter Hemner had presented the mission intel with his usual faux enthusiasm, and standard extra pauses between phrases he deemed important.</p>

<p>Hemner: “…LISTEN UP! For extraa intel! Cross-void swarmers! Known in this space as vetaxa’s! Are believed to be swarming! They are capable of jumps in excess of 40 stardex! (~40LY) They are VERY mean and dangerous! They are believed to be responsible for unexplained disappearances! In systems: Matcha’tiak, Hol-dreda, and Eli’par! We are to drop! We are to conduct search and rescue! For Vit’os local militia! The last distress transmission was post fiiive cal cycles! (~ 5 days ago)”</p>

<p>*a few troopers are unable to hide their murmuring thoughts*</p>

<p><em>no chance they are still alive</em> was the gist.</p>

<p>“QUIET AND LISTEN. UP. TROOPERS!!….there may still be survivors! I am authorizing extra gunners! And medical! Per squad! Keep your scanners on the horizon for initial intel! Look out for HIVE MOTHERS!! DO NOT ENGAGE IF ENCOUNTERED!! Reemember, the exa’legionate coollects intel! And seeks exfil! IF A QUEEN OR BRAIN IS FOUND! Heeaavy hitters! Will be brought in to deal with…”</p>

<p>Hemner said more but the intel was clear; command thinks bugs have either eaten, or captured dozens of citizens. We are to search for them and eleminate all hostiles on the planet surface, while the remaining citizens are evacuated. A bug hunt, so, lots of dead bugs, and like any good exa’legionate, keep our eyes on the horizon, for ‘intial intel’; on this drop that would be a sighting of queen or brain.</p>

<p>Coming up on five interdex (~15 hours) down here; long way to go until Hemner pulls us out; he’s kept us boots on the ground for a long time before, several caldex (~days), or until we have contact; be it bug or civilia…. Wait. What is that? Those shadows don’t look like locals; they look spiny and mean. It <em>is</em> easy to tell who the enemy is on bug hunts. Raising trooper lead.</p>

<p>Prix: “Dixo two, movement ahead”<br />
Dixo: “copy”<br />
Dixo: “contact ground swarmers”<br />
<em>PFump-PFump-PFump-Crck-Crck-Crck BRRapp BRRapp</em><br /></p>

<p>Watch for a help request from the lead…looks like they’ve got it handled. They’re really gunning them down, reporting: 20..21..22 dead swarmers, dont even need grenades, just UHV* exa’bolts. Gotta remember to keep an eye on the rocks above…I can’t see anything with all the interference, are those clouds just ash?. 40….45… guess they aren’t going to let me splat any. No ones gotten nicked…….<em>yet</em>. 50…58…60. <em>PFump-mpp-mp BRapp-app-ap</em> *guns silent*</p>

<p>Attack seems over.</p>

<p>An amber symbol starts blinking in the upper HUD; the boss wants a casualty status.</p>

<p>Prix: “Squad I see all green?”</p>

<p>Each trooper confirms —through their own interface— that they have no injuries; as they do, green dots —one for each of the fourteen troopers— light up in the lower right corner of her HUD..</p>

<p>Prix: “Command we are all clear”</p>

<p>Commander Ter Hemner should be pleased at our efficiency?<br />
Not by his tone….<br />
Hemner: “AIRBORNE INCOMING!”<br /></p>

<p><em>CRAAACKackkack</em> *a red icon in her HUD lights, indicating Egor twelve —one of the other two support troopers— is engaging/engaged*</p>

<p>Oh FUJUT!! where are THEY? There’s one falling, dead, there’s the rest, do I even need to use the scope? Got one lined up; gentle squeeze on the trigger; <em>CRAAACKackkack</em> “one bolt, one nerve stem”, these bugs are fast, guess that’s what all the wings are for. FujuT! Ajats!  <em>CRAAACKackkack</em> That one was charging me I think.  <em>CRAAACKackkack</em> That one definitely was; we seem to have some mutual feelings. <em>CRAAACKackkack</em> do I need to activate?…yep <em>CRAAACKackkack</em> Activating distress signal.</p>

<p>Prix: “I’M GETTING CHARGED”<br />
 Dixo: “CONCUSSION GRENADES”<br />
 <em>BOOOMM BOOOMM BOOOMM</em><br />
Ummff! Deploying shield, switching to carbine…shadt…Hemner’s gonna kill me when he finds out I dropped my long range bolter…but those <em>BOOOMM BOOOMMM</em> ajats! Concussion blasts!…<br />
 <em>BOOOMM BOOOMM</em><br />
Ummppff. More ground swarmers are coming, charging through their dead brethren; doesn’t seem smart.<br />
 <em>BOOOMM BOOOMM BOOOMM</em><br /></p>

<p>Dixo: “All contacts terminated”<br />
Hemner: “Squad Hettra you are all clear”<br />
Uhhhghh, just breath…the nausea will pass…the war shock symptoms always do…<br /></p>

<p>*Two of the green lights turned blue in the corner of her HUD indicating casualties, another light indicates the commander has set the squad stance to defensive*</p>

<p>Looks like I’m on the clock. Both injured callsigns —Emyatta six, and Raetera eight— are part of the extra gunners we got, haven’t even met them yet. Powering up position translator, I see a good spot with rock cover. Close to one of the injuries; close my eyes, relax, it’ll be quick, <em>BLAAPBANGannggang</em>. So loud, and bright. Few things put a trooper through a more disorienting experience than a position translation by a standard issue, exa’legionate, location projector.</p>

<p>Opening eyes; stowing my carbine; some more nausea —different than before; also something I’ve experienced a thousand times. Wait till I can feel the ground under my feet…ok heading to the injured trooper *one of the blue dots in her HUD starts blinking*; Raetera eight is getting taken care of, one less injured on the field.</p>

<p>There’s my injured trooper, under plenty of cover, starting vital and data download, starting medical scan, checking-in her injury.</p>

<p>*Both dots start blinking in her HUD.*</p>

<p>Info downloaded: Semeshea Emyatta, callsign Emyatta six; Sedra’hk’not*, —a tough and resilient gene-nexus— has sustained a deep laceration; from mid abdomen, to mid chest; grazing a few bones; no organs damaged; no major blood vessels damaged. There is so much blood on her, the cut must have bled hard. Whatever hit her, put a really wide gash in her —and her armor. Arrestor foam did its job; seal the wound from the atmosphere, stop all the bleeding. She has two hearts, both beating at an elevated rate; she seems to be in some pain, not enough for an acid wound though, no sign of poisoning. Alright, shield detached, firing mount stakes — <em>pmp</em> —, activating atmospheric lock out field, medixae kit and wash cooker powered up.</p>

<p>Prix: “Can you hear me?”<br />
Her face mask goes from opaque to clear, revealing a green, lightly dotted, smooth skinned face with two purple and black eyes; a well angled hemegeniocx face and head: two eyes, two ears, above a protruding, angular nasal passage, all above a singular mouth. Her dots were a purple like her eyes, and made symmetrical, semi circle patterns on her face and smooth head.</p>

<p>One good looking trooper…stay focused Prix…</p>

<p>Her mouth is moving, she’s answering, ugh the translator is lagging…<br />
Shemeshea: “Yes”<br />
I could get used to that voice, translated or not…<br />
Prix: “Once the local air has stabilized, I’m going to remove your armor to get a better scan so I can fix you up”<br />
Shemeshea: “OK doc”<br />
Prix: “Follow the light with your eyes”<br /></p>

<p>Her pupils are dilated, not sure what that means, making a physio query; should do a quick cognitive test while that query runs.<br /></p>

<p>Prix: “Whats you GN-type?”<br />
Shemeshea “Sedra’hk’not”<br /></p>

<p>Atmosphere has stabilized enough, ambient temp has come down, accessing her suit, unlocking her armor. Looks like the query is finished; for her, dilated pupils are a pretty standard parasympathetic response. Interesting…</p>

<p>Prix: “Your name and callsign?”<br />
Shemeshea: “Shemeshea Emyatta, callsign Emyatta six”<br /></p>

<p>Prix: “alright I’m taking your armor off and going to see how bad this is”<br />
Shemeshea “OK doc”<br /></p>

<p>This is definitely were all the blood came from. Impressive physiology; this Sedra trooper is all taught, limber muscle; a born warrior, those spot patterns are…all over…stay focused Prix. Standard medae’bot wash should do it, just have to calibrate it for her. Medae washes are cooking, just enough time to clean and prep the wound.</p>

<p>Prix: “I’ll have something for your pain soon, just have to synthesize it”<br />
Shemeshea: *nods*<br /></p>

<p>Looks like I got most of the bug bits out, wash should dissolve the rest, mag ointment applied.</p>

<p>Prix: “This will sting a bit at first, but should go numb right after”<br />
Shemeshea: *nods*<br /></p>

<p>Sting? Probably feels cool after a laceration with…ohh there was some acid. Definitely should be cooler. Applying the medae wash. According the her gene-nexus data, her body creates cells which can neutralize foreign acid. She is a piece of art, commissioned and rendered for the life of a legionate, not unlike me.</p>

<p>Prix: “Your wound was a deep laceration, do you know what hit you?”<br />
Shemeshea: “A flyer, with a talon”<br /></p>

<p>“There was some acid, but your body neutralized it. I’ve applied a medae wash that is rebuilding your tissue. You should be in gunning shape within a setadex (~ 16 minutes) and back to full strength within a cal cycle (~ 1 day). Try to avoid operating heavy weapons until them”<br />
Shemeshea: “I’ll try not to…”</p>

<p>Prix: “Any questions?”<br />
Shemeshea: *shakes her head, her eyes staying on Prix’s face*</p>

<p>Her heart rates are going down, vitals are stable, wound is reacting well. Almost time to say goodbye. Those dark eyes; black discs with iris rings that looked made from living dark amethyst; also still dilated; I think it takes more than the pain drugs to explain…oh shadt! How long was I staring at her eyes!?</p>

<p>Might as well say something, as long as shes still checked-in as an injury they had a private channel. Breath deep.</p>

<p>Prix: “Do you like bunk visitors?”<br />
She’s looking at me but not saying anything…did she not understand? maybe she’s…<br />
Shemeshea: “Yes”</p>

<p>Whew…okay lets not draw any attention from the bosses. Deactivating atmospheric exclusion field, stowing medi kit, stowing shield.<br /></p>

<p>Prix: “Can you get up?”</p>

<p>She’s taking my hand; already regaining strength, more than enough to walk again. A rare, easy remediation</p>

<p>Her heart rate has gone down more, but still slightly elevated.<br />
What would she think if she could see my heart rate like I can see hers?</p>

<p>It’s now or never, remember to breath….<br />
Prix: “Can I visit your bunk sometime?”<br /></p>

<p>Why did that sound so awkward?
Time and moments seemed to stretch, conspiring to make me wait as long as possible —no matter how long she took to make up her mind.</p>

<p>Shemeshea: *nods*<br />
I can’t remember the last time I wanted a ‘yes’ so bad.<br /></p>

<p>Prix: “Your clear for battle duty trooper, good luck”<br />
Shemeshea: “Thanks doc”<br /></p>

<p>As I sign off on her returning to duty, her dot stops blinking and turns from blue to green.</p>

<p>Shemeshea’s faceplate goes from clear to flat grey, matching the ground and sky; she attaches maga’suture buttons in several places on either side of the gash in her armor. Magautoriom fibers deploy from the buttons; the fibers grasp each other and tighten; the rift of tega’steel plate running up and down her chest and abdomen closes.</p>

<p>Her defenses restored, she turns and jogs off in the direction of her assigned position, just like I will soon. The remaining blue dot turns green and the commander sets the combat stance to combat ready: patrol. Time to get to high ground.</p>

<p>I feel guilty sometimes —using my position to find companionship, technically a breach of protocol. But I’ve never met a Sedra, and in the legionate, finding someone ‘compatible’ to share a bunk with is very rare. I certainly didn’t expect to find one on this drop. If someone is in a desert, can you blame them for wanting to find a way to water? Maybe the squad has to wait a little longer before moving on…but hey, it gives my patient some more time to rest before returning to eventual-almost-certian-death, and who knows what we are marching into at this point anyway? I seemed to remember, even in my short time in the legionate, a savant-of-war saying “…on <em>occasion</em>, <em>more</em> strategic value can be gained from <em>waiting</em>, then taking <em>action</em>“…or something like that.</p>

<p>Even for me, <em>especially</em> for me, death is never far. The long night will take me eventually; like it does almost all of the legionate troopers. It might be by a bug, or by a zealot, or by a billion other deadly things, but it will happen, and before it does, I intend to find what comfort I can.</p>
