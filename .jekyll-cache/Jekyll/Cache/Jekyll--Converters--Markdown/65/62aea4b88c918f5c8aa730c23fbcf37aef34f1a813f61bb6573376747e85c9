I"ç<p>I thought I must be dreaming that
I thought I was awake,
For I was without question in
A most peculiar state.</p>

<p>Who was thinking I was dreaming
I was thinking in my sleep?
Was I awake while sleeping?
Oh, this was far too deep!</p>

<p>Or was I dreaming I was thinking
I was dreaming in the night?
And would I wake up tired or rested
Come the morning light?</p>

<p>The alarm beeped, and quickly I
Rolled off the rumpled bed,
Grateful for the clarity
That lit the day ahead.</p>
