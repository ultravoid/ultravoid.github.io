#### The Chronicle of the Hyper-Kon, book 13, chapter 1, verse 1

Lat'rel brought fire to the Dread Ones<br>
The hero of Ya'tacu plucked them from the sky<br>
Lat'rel pointed to Godorix the butcher<br>
And before her feet touched the ground<br>
Lat'rel sent him to his gods<br>

Dread Knights know not surrender<br>
Dread Knights know only blood and fire<br>

Lat'rel gave them blood and fire - translated from the Hyper-Kon, by Vetaxa poet of the Eglise'es

#### _We Go On_ song of the Sotor Gim'det

We go on<br>
We go on<br>

It was not the end<br>
First comet emptied our ocean<br>
and washed our shores away<br>

First comet put fire to our sky<br>
and sheathed our cradle in smoke<br>
It was not the end<br>

We go on<br>
We go on<br>

It was not the end<br>
Second comet emptied our hope<br>
and washed our fears away<br>

Second comet put courage in our minds<br>
and blew the smoke from our hearts<br>
It was not the end<br>

We go on<br>
We go on<br>
