**Galaxy: Hegus'dra**<br>
**Satellite Galaxy: Imro'eth* (the galaxy of iron)**<br>
**Sector: Set-dihex 1141 (protectorate designation)**<br>
**Planet: Demptoria**<br>
**City: Pezemtpa** —Capital and seat of government for the Semme'tatra Federation, homeworld to the Ekta'ra<br>

_Daemos Rexus*_

How long did it take these people to build their towers? Fine works of stone and iron. Taller than mountains.<br>
Only generations of blood and will can raise such things; the blood of ancestors, spent to give a birth right to their descendants.<br>
And now I come —the Razer Prince*— to burn that which they have forfeited, and bring an end to these peoples legends and dreams.

In the distance, siege artillery shells, strike a shield that has stood for a million zera'ton (~ 500,000 years). _Bom. Bom. Bom._ Every impact lighting up the protective dome and the city towers beneath with angry branching sparks that split and crawl into the night.<br>

Each shell, brings this city closer to its destiny, a fate these arrogant _Ekta'ra_ sealed themselves, when they defied the my father —the Emperor Diatas. _Bom. Bom. Bom._ The vengeance of my Lion Knights will be brutal, as is fitting for these Ekta'ra who dishonor us with their insolence. My father does not like repeating himself, in his wisdom, mercy leads to repetition.

_Bom. Bom. Bom._

The dynast aide, Lotax'vet —the grey— speaks, his translated voice electronic and flat to the prince's ears. "Lord Prince General, the city shields fall." As he foretells, a blinding flash encompasses the city; blue-green arcs of energy snap into the air and ground. The sky above the city becomes an iridescent dome which then vanishes with a loud bang.

_SNNCRAAACKSHPOPoppop_

Lotax turns slightly to face his master, his metallic form glinting from beneath his hooded robe. "Only the garrison defends the city now my Prince." he said.<br>
"The garrison will fight to the last." It will be a _beautiful_, bloody slaughter...<br>
"They will my lord. Your Star-Lions* will accommodate their courage. Shall the army continue as planned my Lord Prince?"<br>
"Yes...tell the arch'battalions* to cease bombardment. I want every nook and escape tunnel intact so that the razka* hunters can flush out _all_ the infidelos* vermin."<br>
"As you wish my lord" Doors swosh open as Lotax exits to disseminate his orders. Waiting acolyte-adjutants* stand still and silent beyond in the adjutant enclave.<br>

The 'eternal' shields fell within a dunestar (~2 weeks), the Lord Generals will not give Lotax problems carrying out my plan. Ladros, Uthmar, Vi'kete, and the rest of the Lord _argent'generals*_ didn't think the shields would fall that quickly, that the Ekta'ra would have time to escape. They were right. Until my little mouse that is. If not for her actions, the shields would still stand. I have yet to decided if I should spare her...

Lotax returns from the adjutant enclave were he made the Lord Prince's will known, the adjutants now in great activity beyond the enclave doors. "All Generals are affirming your orders Lord Prince" he said.

"As they should. Sev'attendexi\*." Vanix'ferri —the sev'attendexi— replies as she was trained to —in elegant and distinguished Hai'Dre'Cledeshem*. "Yes my glorious Prince?"<br>
Such a fine sev'attendexi.<br>
"I will address the army and my knights."<br>
Vanix works the consoles in front of her —with her four arms— opening audio channels to all Hyperg'enot military elements on the planet. Her task complete she says "All-hands, two-way audio established. My radiant Lord Prince may speak when he pleases"<br>

Such a good pet, and such a good investment —those extra arms. It is always a thrill to project ones voice to so many champions. Remember what father always says about these times. They fight for blood-honor.<br>
"Glorious Knights!" The rhythmic pounding of god-hammer gauntlets, war-lances, and his own voice —echoing off of the battlements and the land— fill the command enclave.<br>
"I CAN HEAR YOU KNIGHTS" The pounding gets louder. The monstrous crashes of the knight's twenty eight bestere (12 meter) long war-lances against their god-hammer gauntlets, was deafening.<br>
"These Ekta'ra have no faith in the Diatas!" The din of the war-lances drowns out the chants from the army. Instead the arch'battalions and glorious infantry make themselves heard with bronze and brass seige horns. From the army ranks, menacing tones growl and spit while mixing with the knight's crashing of steel.<br>
"They are ungrateful for the gifts they have on this world! They have rejected my fathers generosity! They dishonor us, by refusing to surrender what is ours!" Shells no longer fall on the city, but the din echoing off the walls alone seems to threaten to flatten the city.<br>
"Their unbreakable shield is broken, their garrison awaits SLAUGHTER" _Hydaaa Hydaaa Hydaaa_ _Rexus Revmet Rexus Revmet_ Amplified chants for glory of the Hyperg'enot, begin to mix with the pounding god-hammers and blaring siege horns.<br>

"Arch'battalions! Bring down that wall!"

_Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom bom_

The battalion's shells land true, and an entire let'con (~2 mile) stretch of ancient wall, blossoms into grey dusty fireballs. As the dust clears it reveals shining buildings of glass and steel beyond.

"I Lord Princes Daemos Rexus decree that the Ekta'ra are shaka'infidelos*. Storm this capital city! Crush their warriors, and send them to their gods of courage! All Ekta'ra; be they adult, infirm, child, or infant! Put them to flame and blade! _Tear_ into them! Until they are but meat for dogs! Wreath them in flame until their bones are _ash_! Give them death! Give them the _freedom_ they so desire! When you are done my Knights, whatever is left can beg for slavery or death! Put this city _Pezemtpa_ to righteous fire! May its name never again be spoken! Hyperg'enot eternal legion! Advance!" Even after Vanix cut the feed, the war cries of the eternal legion still filled the command enclave, only fading with distance as they advanced on the doomed city.

They could have given it up piece meal. Instead we will burn everything until the name Ekta'ra is only a memory. The disgraced ground of this planet —Demptoria— will feed many colonies; its bones will build many shard-cruisers, chariots, war-lances, and god-hammers. Its core will armor them all. Whatever is left will be for slaves and fertilizer. We will take all of it as we please. All of it.

"The Lion-Knights are engaging the city garrison. The infidelos fall quickly. They fall to the last." Intoned Lotax.

I want to see them. I want to watch as the legacy of this place dies. "Ready my guard and thunder-talon. I want to be there as these people die."<br>
"By your will, my Prince."

Glory eternal to the Hyperg'enot. Death and oblivion to the infidelos
