_Shresta Primatt (Void city)_

_The border of the Erappa(the 'freeworlds')_

As their shuttle thrusters fired to alter course, Getta'tai and Regma'tai were pushed hard into their seats and Regma could only speak between fights for breath. "this wasn't a good idea....you are going too fast...our orbit is too low....we're going to get fined again" Regma'tai complained to her mate and partner "hmpf..whatever" replied Getta'tai, his bright yellow eyes darting between consoles and gauges as he worked the shuttle controls with his slender, dark chen gara hands "you knew if we got stuck behind that _Semlous_ freighter we could of been floating in mag lock for another ritodex (~11 days)..." Regma left it at that and went back to monitoring the shuttle instruments, if something was going to fail it would be now. A cold death was as close as misjudgment or bad luck Regma's first father had always said. He also said not to add distracting arguments to that list of hazards, especially ones that could be settled later.

Getta powered down the thrusters, easing them from their seats and putting the shuttle on its final path to their destination, which was the mega city space station _Shresta Primatt_ orbiting the gas giant _Shresta_. The planet _Shresta_ itself —which had given the station its name— was a large, hot ball of gas with more than a hundred moons in the _Bara'tex_ star system. When the ancestors of Getta and Regma first floated to this world they knew it to be a special place, with moons that were bountiful in metals and ices and a large magnetic field....everything a _chen gara_ (peta'megi, 'star borne') needed to thrive and build.

In addition to plentiful resources, Shresta burns with radiation, Regma could feel it like a low, cold tingle giving vigor to her body and bones. More so when they traveled to the city from their home on the far moon. The chen gara had adapted to the cosmic fields in the endless vacuum, and what causes sickness in many firma bound species, gives them life.

"looks like we are in range of the supply net signal..." Getta said, without responding Regma powered up the radio antennas and receivers, and downloaded the latest manifests from the logi guilds on the station... "We have a signal. They have everything we need it looks like" Regma said as she scanned the provision guild inventories with some disappointment... "not much fresh fruit though" she said to Getta, making her smooth dark angular face disappointed. Getta responded with regret in his voice "agh, that is unfortunate..."

As had become their habit over the 20 adex (~20 years) they had made this journey, once they had a enough com signal to get data streams Getta attempted to raise the station landing towers "...Shresta tower this is cargo shuttle _Setak'tai_ on apoapsis intercept, requesting public berthing..." After the fourth try the _Shresta_ landing authority responded "We see you shuttle _Setak'tai_ at ten interum (1000 seconds) to mag lock, twelve interum to descent...cutting it close shuttle _Setak'tai_..." the station continued with instructions to prepare to for docking and, to Regma's relief no mention of their high speed approach.

_Shresta Primatt_ is a massive, ancient construct of steel and stone finished white in the tradition of the chen gara. It had been built in orbit by the ancestors of Getta and Regma nearly five tekadex (~5,000 years) ago. Then —by its original plans— it had a circumference of ten tekudex (~15 miles) with enough centrifugal habs to house a hundred thousand _chen gara_. Over time like many other bastions of the void borne, it had grown with needs and populations. In the time of Regma and Getta _Shresta Primatt_ is home to millions of souls from thousands of gene-lines and its size is a hundred fold its original. Now it is a great amalgamation of hab sectors, shipyards, foundries, and trade hubs, all inhabited by _chen gara_ and hundreds of other races and species. As more sections were added, tall spires were built, and those spires were eventually connected by platforms and bridges, and on those were built more towers and platforms, to those were attached workshops and trade sectors, and on top of those still even taller spires were raised.

It is one of the best examples of a void borne "space mega city" and Regma felt a buzz of pride for her ancestors that built the _Shresta Primatt_. Written deep below the spires and foundries on the original section's hull, the builders wrote the station's motto on a platinum plate etched in diamond and gold, _"In the sky of Shresta this station shines, until the frontier breaks"_.

When the city is viewed from a higher orbit, it resembles a scalloped plate floating across the brown, red, and white clouds of _Shresta_, or, some might say a flower-shaped cookie floating in tea with cream. Viewed from below —the direction from which shuttle _Setak'tai_ approached— it appears as it is, a massive city floating in the stars with uncountable towers reaching 20 or 30 tekudex (~30-45 miles) or farther into space from the main station.

As the _Setak'tai_ approached from below, _Shresta Primatt_ began to move into the shadow of _Shresta_. The sunset bathed the bottom of the station in deep scarlet red followed by the advancing shadow of night. As Regma watched the spectacle of artificial night overtake the brilliant red, and the station lights lit up in its wake, she reached across the the cockpit and grasped Getta's hand. He grasped back and smiled...it was a rare and beautiful sight that they had only witnessed a handful of times. "I'll take that as good luck" Getta said, Regma was reminded of an old _chen gara_ saying _"There is much beauty and hardship in the void, do not meet either alone"_.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

One could tell their whereabouts in Shresta Primatt (or most space cities) by the smell, as soon as the shuttle air locks opened and its air flew out to exchange with the station atmosphere, Regma detected slick grease, acrid fuel, things burning, distant food, subtle rot, and the low smells of the living...she was at the docks...she was home. The clank of their mag boots on the landing deck joined a innumerable chorus of others as they made their way to the landing authority. As they waited for their turn to report to the authority Regma reviewed their supply list which had been written and grouped in no particular order...

Time to make the errand list she thought. "which guilds do you want this time?" She asked Getta as they waited in line, after a moment he said "I can get the cables and metals...I know how much you hate the new fabricators...if you get the provisions and the chem guild stuff, and then we can meet at the tech guild for the transmitters" She nodded just as the authority clerk sitting behind security glass called through a speaker "NEXT"

The clerk was a many armed and many eyed ancient Remat'hypa who's auto translated voice played haltingly through the speaker "what is...your purpose...on...Shresta Primatt?" Getta responded to the traditional bureaucratic welcome "supply run from Andra Palnus, Vetma'rahd". The clerk responded with the same tempo

clerk: "are your...supplies...for maintenance or building?"<br>
Getta: "both"<br>
clerk: "what...is your...charter?"<br>
Getta: "citizen, co-custodian, frontier breaker"<br>
clerk: "and...your companion?"<br>
Getta: "the same"<br>
clerk: \*after consulting some unseen data\* "your shuttle...may have...two caldex cycles...in the...public berth, if you require...housing...visit the...Shresta Primatt...housing authority...read and...give heed to...all warnings...while visiting...Shresta Primatt...an accidental...death...is never far"

As Getta was thanking the authority and getting their keys Regma noticed an unusual group of tan and red uniformed station gendarmes gathering at a large airlock. They formed a line encircling the airlock exit, after they had settled into their places the airlock opened and a striking being in black and silver robes walked out flanked by menacing looking black armored escorts. The being was tall with a smooth oval mirrored helmet they did not remove, she thought they were totally bipedal at first, but then she saw a second set of arms moving under their robes.

Behind them were more menacing escorts —who's mag boots sounded loud on the deck unlike their master— with what looked to be a prisoner with their hands restrained in between two of them. "have you ever seen anything like that?" she asked Getta once he was done with the station clerk. "looks like they're bringing someone in, maybe a wanted pirate?" Getta offered "who are 'they'" Regma responded motioning to the tall black and silver clad entity and their escort on the landing deck below "I don't know...not the legion or protectorate...must be one of those 'free riders'...or whatever they call themselves..." "hmmm" Regma mused...quickly forgetting them as thoughts of their next task formed in her mind.

She had tried not to think much about the unpleasant topic but could avoid it no more...she turned to Getta and asked "so..." his sigh and bowed head told her he already knew what she was going to say "...who's family do we visit first?"
