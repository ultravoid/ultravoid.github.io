**Galaxy: Gemi'holon**<br>
**Sector: Emhetra**<br>
**System: Reg'tiak**<br>

It was a bug hunt. I hate bug hunts, hive swarmers feel no pain, and dispense it without mercy. My job is much harder on bug hunts. What do they want with this shadt hole of a world anyway? It's not very green, the weather matches the landscape, bleak and uninviting. Despite the grey clouds, rain has not touched this dusty ground in a long time I'm guessing; there is plenty of lightning though, blue and white snaps that compliment the sharp angles of the terrain. Legionatus command had sent her squad of exa'legionate troopers to these mountains to find a local militia, that had gone missing while responding to distressed citizens. The latest of many mysterious disappearances on this border world.

During pre-drop briefing, command had informed them that cross-void swarmers —with an impossibly long official designation but known in this space simply as vetaxa's— had been moving quickly throughout this sector. The suddenly missing citizens in mass, seemingly random episodes where little or no traces are left, combined with known vetaxa's activity; made Legionatus command believe the would be a bug hunt for vetaxa's swarmers. This mission will end like they usually do thought Prix —lots of dead bugs. Not expecting much beyond that.

At least —during a bug hunt— it's easy to tell friend from foe. Prix's eyes caught a spiny shadow moving far ahead of her squad.

"Dixo two, movement ahead"<br>
Dixo: "copy"<br>
_pfump pfump pfump brapp brapp_<br>

The troopers fired their mag bolters into a swarm pouring out from the low rocks, the bolter reports mixing with sharp bangs from the expolding bolt ammunition. That's 20..21..22, her nero-interface updating command with the number of dead swarmers. Gotta remember to keep an eye on the rocks above...I can't see anything with all that interference. After what she estimated was at least 60 swarmers getting gunned down, the din of gunfire abruptly stopped. The attack seems over.

A blinking amber symbol in her upper HUD told her the boss wanted an update.

Prix: "Squad I see all green?"

Each trooper confirmed through their own interface they had no injuries; as they did, green dots lighted up in the lower right corner of her HUD; until fourteen —one for each trooper— was lit.

Prix: "Command we are all clear"

Commander Ter Hemner should be pleased at our efficiency? Not by his tone....<br>
Hemner: "AIRBORNE INCOMING!"

 _CRAAACK_ She couldn't tell which other support trooper fired the heavy bolter shot, but she followed its victim's fall backwards to the rest of the incoming airborne swarm. In a single movement she swung her heavy bolter up to sight and meet the air ambushers. They look nasty, —everything the pre-drop briefing had promised— talons and spines, animated by a furious, destructive, primal instinct; all attached to more wings than seems necessary. _CRAAACK_ her bolt went dead center through the nerve stem of a flyer; it tumbled forwarded, the echoing from her shot still sounding when it plunged into the ground. _CRAACK_.._CRAACK_ two more down. Trooper mag bolters —sounding like small puffs compared to her long range rifle— joined into taking down the flyers. Seemingly syncronized with the flyers, ground swarmers charged out from the rocks and over the bodies of their fallen brethren. _BOOOMM BOOOMM BOOOMM_ guess the troopers decided to bring out the bigger munitions. _BOOOMM BOOOMM_ Yeah, splattered the last bit it looks like.

 In the corner of her HUD two of the green lights turned blue, indicating minor wounds. Looks like I'm on the clock. She powered up her position translator and teleported into the cover of some rocks near the squad. A bright flash followed by a shrieking bang giving away her movement and destination. Opening eyes that she closed to ease translation disorientation, she felt the ground under her feet, stowed her weapon, deployed her medic shield, and turned to find the wounded troopers. One of the blue dots started blinking; one of the other support troopers had gotten to the other injured trooper and was assessing.

There they are, plenty of cover, defensive perimeter setup, checking in the injury and downloading their info and vitals, scanning the trooper.

 Both dots start blinking in her HUD.

 Semeshea Emyatta, callsign Emyatta 6; Sedra'hk'not, —a tough and resilient gene nexus— had sustained a deep gash; grazing a few bones; from mid abdomen, to mid chest. The gash must have bled hard for so much blood to get out before her suit sealed her with arrestor foam. Both of her hearts are beating at an elevated rate; she seems to be in some pain, not enough for an acid wound though, no sign of poising. Alright, shield detached, firing mount stakes — _pmp_ —, activating atmospheric lock out field, med kit and wash cooker powered up.

 Prix: "Can you her me?"<br>
 Her face mask goes from opaque to clear, revealing a green smooth skinned face with two purple and black eyes and a well angled hemegeniocx type face and head —two eyes, above a protruding nasal passage, above a single mouth. Wow she's good looking...stay focused Prix...

The nice mouth speaks.<br>
Shemeshea: "Yes"<br>
I could get used to that voice, translated or not...<br>
Prix: "I'm going to remove your armor to get a better scan so I can fix you up"<br>
Shemeshea: "OK doc"<br>
Prix: "Follow the light with your eyes"<br>

Her pupils are dilated, not sure what that means, making a physio query; should do a quick cognitive test while that runs.<br>
Prix: "Whats you GN-type?"<br>
Shemeshea "Sedra'hk'not"<br>

Atmosphere has stabilized enough, accessing her suit, unlocking her armor. Looks like the query is finished; for her, dilated pupils are a pretty standard parasympathetic response. Interesting...

Prix: "And your name and callsign?"<br>
Shemeshea: "Shemeshea Emyatta, callsign Emyatta 6"<br>

Prix: "alright I'm taking your armor and off and going to see how bad this is"<br>
Shemeshea "OK doc"<br>

This is definitely were all the blood came from. Impressive physiology; this Sedra is all taught, limber muscle; a born warrior...stay focused Prix. Standard medae'bot wash should do it, just have to calibrate it for her. Medi washes are cooking, just enough time to clean and prep the wound.

Prix: "I'll have something for your pain soon, just have to synthesize it"<br>
Shemeshea: \*nods\*<br>

All ready; looks like I got most of the bug bits out, wash should dissolve the rest, mag ointment applied.

Prix: "This will sting a bit at first, but should go numb right after"<br>
Shemeshea: \*nods\*<br>

Prix: "Your wound was a deep laceration, do you know what hit you?"<br>
Shemeshea: "A flyer did; with one of their talons"

"There was some mild acid, but your body neutralized most of it. You are healing now and should be in fighting shape within a setadex (~ 16 minutes) and back to full strength within a cal cycle (~ 1 day). Try to avoid operating heavy weapons until them"<br>
Shemeshea: "I'll try not to..."

Prix: "Do you have any question for me?"<br>
Shemeshea: \*shakes her head eyes staying Prix's face\*

Heart rates are going down, wound is reacting well. Almost time to say good by. Those dark eyes, almond discs with rings of what could be dark living amethyst making her irises, they have a haunting glint to them; also still dilated; i think it takes more than the pain drugs to explain...oh shadt! How long was I staring into her eyes!? Might as well say something...breath deep.

Prix: "Do you like bunk visitors?"<br>
She's looking at me but not saying anything...did she not understand? maybe she's to much of a rookie to...<br>
Shemeshea: "Yes"

Deactivating atmospheric exclusion field, stowing medi kit, stowing shield, she takes my hand I offer to help her up, looks like she's already strong enough to walk again. These are rare, normally I would be immersed in gratefulness at such an easy casualty remediation; something else was on my mind though.

As I sign off on her returning to duty; one of the dots stops blinking and turns from blue. Shemeshea's faceplate goes from clear to flat grey matching the ground and sky. She attaches suture buttons in several places on either side of the gash in her armor. The buttons deploy magautoriom fibers which grasp each other from across the rift of tega'steel armor plate and tighten, closing the gap in her defensives; the warrior fixes her tools of the trade in the same way that Prix fixes the tools of the Legionatus —the exa'legionate troopers like Shemeshea.

If only she could see my heart rate like I can see hers....<br>
Prix: \*Breathing deep; seemingly deep in study checking her out of the trooper casualties\*<br>
"Can I visit you sometime?"

Shemeshea \*nods and jogs of to return to duty\*
