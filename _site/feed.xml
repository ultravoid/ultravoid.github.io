        <title>The Blood Ghosts of Nexi</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galaxy: Gemi’holon&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sector: Ter’tai’deroga (erappa)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zemo never liked this world…&lt;em&gt;Nexi&lt;/em&gt; it was called. Things had always been odd at this port of call…little things. Mag compasses were mostly useless, even though they shouldn’t be, and gear that was normally reliable had to be constantly reset. All forms of coms were unreliable, plagued with static, and prone to channels crossing. And if that was not enough reason to be wary of this place, this system was a mere two jumps to the Ogion protectorate frontier markers and the demons beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people here called them selves the &lt;em&gt;Dereese&lt;/em&gt; and they said it was not always like this, they said the strangeness started around 20 adex (~ 20 years) ago…their scientists and researchers had never been able to solve the mystery, and instead they coped…and built their tech to be as stable as it could. He also found the people here odd, and wondered if that had not always been as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that oddness could not explain their behavior now…they had locked down that city in which Zemo’s ship the &lt;em&gt;Sera Freedom&lt;/em&gt; had landed, the captain had ordered all hands back to prep to flee if needed…regardless of items unsold which he ordered left on the landing deck. Some rookie corsairs might think the captain dumb or cowardly, to them he would say - if he cared to say it - “that is the only way a rogue could live as long as the captain…and being prepared to run lightly in space is always wise…“…if he cared to say it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bridge they watched their sensor monitors as the &lt;em&gt;Dereese&lt;/em&gt; fleet massed above their homeworld, the captain ordered Zemo to tap into the surveillance feeds and find out what has happening. Zemo went to his station and worked quickly, the &lt;em&gt;Dereese&lt;/em&gt; did not have a mind for security and he was able to assume an trusted identity with ease. “I’m through” Zemo said through his translator “look in the western continents…” the captain ordered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zemo started going through feeds…they were not organized in any way many were dead static…some were of warehouses, some on streets. Zemo cycled through hundreds of feeds…warehouse after warehouse…some common areas, and more dead signals. At almost his two hundredth feed reconnect Zemo saw something strange, the feed was from a tower overlooking a market area, uniformed soldiers were herding the shopping crowd and clearing the market. “captain, you should see this” as the captain walked over the wail of sirens from outside began building and reached its crescendo when the captain looked over Zemo’s shoulder to see what the found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of one of the streets that the soldiers were herding the citizens into, a panic broke out, they could hear desperate screams through the circuit’s audio feed while at the end of the street what looked like a fine pink mist began roiling into the crowed. Zemo watched as the panic became a visible wave moving through the crowd until the street was a surge of &lt;em&gt;Dereese&lt;/em&gt; running for their life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few seconds the captain had seen enough and roared “FULL POWER TO THE ENGINES NOW!! take off NOW!!”, everyone obeyed quickly and wordlessly as the fusion powered hyper thrusters spun up. Strapped in at his station Zemo watched on unbelievably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mist continued its wispy march into the street while horrified and screaming &lt;em&gt;Dereese&lt;/em&gt; found themselves pulled into it, their faces going from horror to mortal pain. As the mist front got closer Zemo it unveiled a scene of bloody slaughter behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was total carnage, &lt;em&gt;Dereese&lt;/em&gt; body parts and pink blood were everywhere, the stone street drained away the blood forming reverse tributaries fed by piles of death. As Zemo’s mind began to grasp what he was seeing, he though he could see blood jumping and dancing in time with shiny flickers before falling like sticky rain. Something was tearing the &lt;em&gt;Dereese&lt;/em&gt; to pieces and leaving no survivors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think something invisible is out there” Zemo said, as the thrusters power up and Zemo was pushed into his seat, he felt the need to say. “Derehm help us”&lt;/p&gt;
