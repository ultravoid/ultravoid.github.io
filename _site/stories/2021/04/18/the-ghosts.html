    <p><strong>Galaxy: Gemi’holon</strong><br />
<strong>Sector: Ter’tai’deroga (erappa)</strong><br /></p>

<p>Zemo never liked this world…<em>Nexi</em> it was called. Things had always been odd at this port of call…little things. Mag compasses were mostly useless, even though they shouldn’t be, and gear that was normally reliable had to be constantly reset. All forms of coms were shaky, plagued with static, and prone to channels crossing. If all that was not enough reason for Zemo to be wary of this place, Nexi was a mere two jumps from the protectorate frontier markers and the Ogion hunters and demons beyond.</p>

<p>The people here called themselves the <em>Dereese</em> and they said it was not always like this, they said the strangeness started around 20 adex (~ 20 years) ago…their scientists and researchers had never been able to solve the mystery, and instead they coped…and built their tech to be as stable as it could be. He also found the people here odd, and wondered if that had not always been as well.</p>

<p>All of that oddness could not explain their behavior now…without reason or warning they had locked down the port city in which Zemo’s ship the <em>Sera Freedom</em> had landed, and the government com channels had become a wash of panicked officials relaying orders which they seemed to not understand. The captain had ordered all hands back to the ship and to make preparations to break through and flee the lockdown if needed. The items they had intended to sell he ordered left on the landing deck.</p>

<p>Some rookie corsairs might think the captain dumb or cowardly for such actions, to them Zemo would say - if he cared to say it - “that is the only way a rogue could live as long as the captain…and being prepared to run lightly in space is always wise…” - if he cared to say it.</p>

<p>On the bridge of the <em>Sera Freedom</em> the sensor monitors showed the <em>Dereese</em> fleet moving into formations above Nexi. The captain ordered Zemo to use his talents, and tap into the surveillance feeds and find out what has happening. Zemo went to his station and worked quickly, the <em>Dereese</em> did not have a mind for security and, through sub-novum interferomance, he was able to assume a trusted identity with ease. “I’m into their civil surveillance net” Zemo said through his translator “look in the western continents…” said the captain.</p>

<p>Zemo started going through feeds…they were not organized in any way, many were dead static…some were of warehouses, some on streets. Zemo cycled through dozens and dozens of everyday scenes of life on Nexi…warehouse after warehouse…common areas, streets, hab sectors…and more dead signals.</p>

<p>At almost his two hundredth feed reconnect Zemo saw something strange, the feed was from a tower overlooking a market area, <em>Dereese</em> soldiers in grey and purple uniforms were herding a crowd of civilians from the market and into a street. “captain, you should see this” as the captain walked over a wailing siren from the city began building and reached its crescendo when the captain looked over Zemo’s shoulder to see what the found.</p>

<p>At the end of one of the streets that the soldiers were herding the citizens into, a panic broke out, they could hear desperate screams through the circuit’s audio feed while at the end of the street what looked like a fine pink mist began roiling into the crowed. Zemo watched as the panic became a visible wave moving through the crowd until the street was a surge of <em>Dereese</em> running for their life.</p>

<p>After a few seconds the captain had seen enough and roared “FULL POWER TO THE ENGINES NOW!! take off NOW!!”, everyone obeyed quickly and wordlessly as the fusion powered hyper thrusters spun up. Strapped in at his station Zemo watched on unbelievably.</p>

<p>The mist continued its wispy march into the street pulling horrified and screaming <em>Dereese</em> into it, their faces going from horror to mortal pain as they were overtaken. As the mist front got closer to the camera it unveiled a scene of bloody slaughter behind it.</p>

<p>It was total carnage, <em>Dereese</em> body parts and pink blood were everywhere, the stone street drained away the blood forming reverse tributaries fed by piles of death. As Zemo’s mind began to grasp what he was seeing, he thought he could see blood jumping and dancing in time with shiny metallic flickers from the mist front before falling as sticky rain. Something was tearing the <em>Dereese</em> to pieces and leaving no survivors.</p>

<p>“I think something invisible is out there” Zemo said, as the thrusters powered up and pushed Zemo hard into his seat, he felt the need to say. “Derehm help us”</p>
